--Tweet Generator Using Markov Chains--
Authored by Nadav Robinson 212544779

Generate unique tweets by analyzing an existing dataset using Markov Chains, a powerful technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
This project demonstrates how to use probabilistic models to produce synthetic text while preserving the tone and structure of the original data.

--Features--

-Create new sentences that mimic the style of the input dataset.
-Simple and intuitive implementation of Markov Chains.
-Easily customizable to work with any text dataset.
-Learn the foundations of probabilistic modeling in NLP.

--Data Structures and Files--

-Files in the Project-

chain_markov.h:
Header file containing the skeleton of core functions for building and traversing the Markov Chain.

chain_markov.c:
Implementation of the functions defined in chain_markov.h.

list_linked.c and list_linked.h:
Implementation of a linked list for managing states and transitions in the Markov Chain.

generator_tweets.c:
Contains the main function and additional helper function for loading data, and filling database.

-Data Structures-

MarkovChain:
Represents the Markov Chain as a database of states and their transitions using linked list.

MarkovNode:
Represents a state in the Markov Chain with its associated data and a frequency list for possible transitions.

MarkovNodeFrequency:
Represents a transition between two states in the Markov Chain, including the frequency of the transition.


--How To Compile--
run 'gcc tweets_generator.c markov_chain.c linked_list.c -o tweets_generator'

--How To Run--
run './tweets_generator <seed> <number of tweets to generate> <path to input file> <amount of words to read>'
Example: ./tweets_generator 454545 10 input_file.txt 150
